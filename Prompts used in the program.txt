1. Create a Java application to read this file and print out the field values.
---create a java program called readXMLfile.java to read an XML file and print out the field values


2. Change your Java application to only output user-selected fields from that XML file.
---edit the program to only output user-selected fields from the xml file (through user-interaction)

3. Now change it to output the user-selected fields in JSON format.
---edit the program so that the user-selected fields are output in JSON format (Jackson)

4. Now include enough validation so that your program does not crash if the user
types in something unexpected.
--Include enough validation so that the program does not crash from unexpected user input

5. Now switch to using the SAX XML parser instead
---make the program use the SAX XML parser
